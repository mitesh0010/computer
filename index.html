        <p>  Computer literacy is defined as the knowledge and ability to utilize computers 
            and related technology efficiently, with a range of skills covering levels from elementary use to computer
             programming and advanced problem solving. Computer literacy can also refer to the comfort level someone has
              with using computer programs...</p>

        <p>  The term "computer literacy" is usually attributed to Arthur Luehrmann, a physicist at Dartmouth College who was
             a colleague of Kemeny and Kurtz who introduced the BASIC programming language in 1964. Luehrmann became a tireless
              advocate of computers in teaching. At an April 1972 American Federation of Information Processing Societies (AFIPS)
               conference, Luehrmann gave a talk titled "Should the computer teach the student, or vice-versa?" The paper is available
                online. In it he notes:

            If the computer is so powerful a resource that it can be programmed to simulate the instructional process, shouldn't
             we be teaching our students mastery of this powerful intellectual tool? Is it enough that a student be the subject of
              computer administered instructionâ€”the enduser of a new technology? 
              
              Or should his education also include learning to use 
              the computer  to get information in the social sciences from a large database inquiry system, or  to simulate an
               ecological system, or  to solve problems by using algorithms, or  to acquire laboratory data and analyze it, or 
                to represent textual information for editing and analysis,
                
                 or  to represent musical information for analysis, or
                 to create and process graphical information? These uses of computers in education cause students to become masters 
                of computing, not merely its subjects.
            
            In 1978, Andrew Molnar was director of the Office of Computing Activities at the National Science Foundation in the United
             States. Shortly after its formation, computer literacy was discussed in several academic articles. In 1985 the 
             Journal of Higher Education asserted that being computer literate involved mastering word processing, spreadsheet
              programs, and retrieving and sharing information on a computer.</p>
